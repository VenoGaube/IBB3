It contains 40 different images, ranging from 1 face per image to multiple.\n+\n+\n+The program will then process all the images inside of the RHCP folder and display the following messages inside the Terminal.\n+\n+![alt text](docs/2.%20Korak.PNG)\n+\n+After creating the networks and loading the parameters it will start finding the faces within the provided images.\n+When it is done it will display the number of "face images".\n+\n+![alt text](docs/3.%20Korak.PNG)\n+\n+It will process the data and cluster the data using Chinese Whispers. When it is done clustering it will display all the images with the \n+bounding boxes containing their clustered face ID. \n+\n+Here you can just press Enter or any other key to go through all the images with their assigned\n+cluster ID bounding boxes.\n+\n+![alt text](docs/4.%20Korak.PNG)\n+\n+After going through the unsupervised learning part we begin our supervised part, where the\n+user helps the program learn and provides it with a learning data set.\n+\n+First the program displays a menu where the user can check all the created clusters with their assigned face images.\n+Here press the "Brose Files" button to be redirected to the menu where the clustered images are stored.\n+![alt text](docs/5.%20Korak.PNG)\n+![alt text](docs/6.%20Korak.PNG)\n+\n+Go through the images and if one cluster is full of images that aren\'t faces or are faces of random people throw that folder away, by just selecting it and pressing "Delete".\n+It is really important that you delete the unneeded or false face detection folders, since the next step\n+will display 8 random images from each of these folders for the user to assign on their own. Mostly with this database the useful folders are 0, 1, 3 and 4. \n+\n+![alt text](docs/7.%20Korak.PNG)\n+\n+Then just press the "X" or Cancel and in the Menu press "Exit".\n+\n+![alt text](docs/5.%20Korak.PNG)\n+\n+The program will display one image from the folder and an accompanying Input text box.\n+It is really important that you mark the same faces with the same name, otherwise too many\n+folders will be created and the program will receive wrong learning data.\n+In this case I\'ve marked each of 4 different faces with the letters \'A\', \'B\', \'C\' and \'D\'.\n+Lower or upper case doesn\'t matter since the program turns all strings into upper case.\n+\n+\n+![alt text](docs/9.%20Korak.PNG)\n+\n+After going through all the images and assigning all the faces a "name" the program\n+will learn from the marked images and do it\'s own prediction on the remaining data, displaying\n+the final result when finished.\n+\n+![alt text](docs/10.%20Korak.PNG)\n\\ No newline at end of file\ndiff --git a/UserInterface.py b/UserInterface.py\nindex c121e81..dd0b56b 100644\n--- a/UserInterface.py\n+++ b/UserInterface.py\n@@ -178,7 +178,7 @@ class OpenWindow:\n         counter_array = [0] * num_of_folders\n \n         counter = 0\n-        limit = 15\n+        limit = 8\n         j = 0\n         i = 0\n         for folder in Path(path).iterdir():\n@@ -614,8 +614,6 @@ path_finder(pathlib.PurePath(os.getcwd()))\n delete_create()\n vse_slike = findImages.get_images()\n \n-\n-\n call_commands()\n # Create the root window\n window = Tk()\ndiff --git a/facenet/src/encodings.py b/facenet/src/encodings.py\nindex 0eb6380..39d67ba 100644\n--- a/facenet/src/encodings.py\n+++ b/facenet/src/encodings.py\n@@ -180,11 +180,7 @@ def main(args):\n                 encodings.append(ImageEncoding(paths[i], emb_array[i]))\n \n             clusters = clustering.cluster_facial_encodings(encodings)\n-            path_test_aligned = os.getcwd() + "\\\\facenet\\\\data\\\\images\\\\test_aligned\\\\gallery"\n-            path_model = os.getcwd() + "\\\\facenet\\\\models\\\\20170512-110547.pb"\n-            results_path = os.getcwd() + "\\\\results"\n-            # arguments_dbscan = HDBSCANArguments(path_test_aligned, results_path, path_model)\n-            # clusters = dbscan_cluster.main(arguments_dbscan)\n+\n             # set clusters\n             for cluster in range(len(clusters)):\n                 # if len(clusters[cluster]) < 5:\n@@ -222,6 +218,8 @@ def main(args):\n             config.result_path = results_path\n \n             for i in range(len(clusters)):\n+                if len(clusters[i]) < 10:\n+                    continue\n                 if len(clusters[i]) < 0:\n                     for o in range(len(clusters[i])):\n                         for j in range(len(config.data)):'
